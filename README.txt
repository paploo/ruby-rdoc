The Ruby 1.9.1p129 RDoc documentation.

Compiled by Jeff Reinecke <jeff@paploo.net> and posted at http://github.com/paploo/ruby-rdoc/.

It took 25 minutes and a hair under 2 GB of RAM (to the process) to compile this
on my MacBook Pro.

After having installed Ruby 1.9.1p129 and verified it worked, I changed
directories to the root ruby-1.9.1p129 director and ran:
  $ rdoc --all --line-numbers --promiscuous --op rdocs .
