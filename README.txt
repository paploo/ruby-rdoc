The Ruby 1.9.2p0 RDoc documentation.

Compiled by Jeff Reinecke <jeff@paploo.net> and posted at http://github.com/paploo/ruby-rdoc/.

After having installed ruby 1.9.2, I changed directories to the root of the source directory and ran:
  $ rdoc --all -o rdocs .
Note that now the arguments --line-numbers and --promiscuous no longer exist.  Also, I removed the 'p' from '-op'.

The new updates to RDoc made it able to run in 136.9 seconds instead of 60+ minutes!
