 *  call-seq:
 *     fiber.transfer(args, ...) -&gt; obj
 *  
 *  Transfer control to another fiber, resuming it from where it last
 *  stopped or starting it if it was not resumed before. The calling 
 *  fiber will be suspended much like in a call to &lt;code&gt;Fiber.yield&lt;/code&gt;.
 *  
 *  The fiber which recieves the transfer call is treats it much like 
 *  a resume call. Arguments passed to transfer are treated like those
 *  passed to resume.
 *     
 *  You cannot resume a fiber that transferred control to another one.
 *  This will cause a double resume error. You need to transfer control
 *  back to this fiber before it can yield and resume.
