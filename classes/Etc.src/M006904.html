  <pre>/* Returns an entry from the /etc/group file. The first time it is called it
 * opens the file and returns the first entry; each successive call returns 
 * the next entry, or nil if the end of the file has been reached.
 *
 * To close the file when processing is complete, call endgrent.
 *
 * Each entry is returned as a Struct::Group:
 *
 * - Group#name contains the name of the group as a String.
 *
 * - Group#passwd contains the encrypted password as a String. An 'x' is
 *   returned if password access to the group is not available; an empty 
 *   string is returned if no password is needed to obtain membership of 
 *   the group.
 *
 * - Group#gid contains the group's numeric ID as an integer.
 *
 * - Group#mem is an Array of Strings containing the short login names of the 
 *   members of the group.
