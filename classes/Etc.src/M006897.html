  <pre>/* Returns an entry from the /etc/passwd file. The first time it is called it
 * opens the file and returns the first entry; each successive call returns 
 * the next entry, or nil if the end of the file has been reached.
 *
 * To close the file when processing is complete, call endpwent.
 *
 * Each entry is returned as a Struct::Passwd:
 *
 * - Passwd#name contains the short login name of the user as a String.
 *
 * - Passwd#passwd contains the encrypted password of the user as a String.
 *   an 'x' is returned if shadow passwords are in use. An '*' is returned
 *   if the user cannot log in using a password.
 *
 * - Passwd#uid contains the integer user ID (uid) of the user.
 *
 * - Passwd#gid contains the integer group ID (gid) of the user's primary group.
 *
 * - Passwd#gecos contains a longer String description of the user, such as 
 *   a full name. Some Unix systems provide structured information in the 
 *   gecos field, but this is system-dependent.
 *
 * - Passwd#dir contains the path to the home directory of the user as a String.
 *
 * - Passwd#shell contains the path to the login shell of the user as a String.
